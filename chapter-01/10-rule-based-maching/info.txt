Match patterns are lists of dictionaries. Each dictionary describes one token. The keys are the names of token attributes, mapped to their expected values.


In this example, we're looking for two tokens with the text "iPhone" and "X".

Match exact token texts
[{"TEXT": "iPhone"}, {"TEXT": "X"}]


We can also match on other token attributes. Here, we're looking for two tokens whose lowercase forms equal "iphone" and "x".

Match lexical attributes
[{"LOWER": "iphone"}, {"LOWER": "x"}]


We can even write patterns using attributes predicted by a model. Here, we're matching a token with the lemma "buy", plus a noun. The lemma is the base form, so this pattern would match phrases like "buying milk" or "bought flowers".

Match any token attributes
[{"LEMMA": "buy"}, {"POS": "NOUN"}]
