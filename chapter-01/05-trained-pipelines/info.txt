A quick tip: To get definitions for the most common tags and labels, you can use the spacy.explain helper function.

For example, "GPE" for geopolitical entity isn't exactly intuitive â€“ but spacy.explain can tell you that it refers to countries, cities and states.

The same works for part-of-speech tags and dependency labels.
