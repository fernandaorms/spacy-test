The code in this example is trying to analyze a text and collect all proper nouns that are followed by a verb.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Berlin looks like a nice city")

# Get all tokens and part-of-speech tags
token_texts = [token.text for token in doc]
pos_tags = [token.pos_ for token in doc]

for index, pos in enumerate(pos_tags):
    # Check if the current token is a proper noun
    if pos == "PROPN":
        # Check if the next token is a verb
        if pos_tags[index + 1] == "VERB":
            result = token_texts[index]
            print("Found proper noun before a verb:", result)
```

Q: Why does this code throw an error?

A: It only uses lists of strings instead of native token attributes. This is often less efficient, and can't express complex relationships.

Response: Always convert the results to strings as late as possible, and try to use native token attributes to keep things consistent.
