Q: To train a model, you typically need training data and development data for evaluation. What is this evaluation data used for?

A: Check predictions on unseen examples and calculate the accuracy score.

Response: The development data is used to evaluate the model by comparing its predictions on unseen examples to the correct annotations. This is then reflected in the accuracy score.
