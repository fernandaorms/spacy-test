### spaCy skills

* Extract **linguistic features**: part-of-speech tags, dependencies, named entities
* Work with trained **pipelines**
* Find words and phrases using Matcher and PhraseMatcher **match rules**
* Best practices for working with **data structures** Doc, Token Span, Vocab, Lexeme
* Find **semantic similarities** using **word vectors**
* Write custom **pipeline components** with **extension attributes**
* **Scale up** your spaCy pipelines and make them fast
* Create **training data** for spaCy's statistical models
* **Train and update** spaCy's neural network models with new data


### More things to do with spaCy (1)

* [Training and updating](https://spacy.io/usage/training) other pipeline components
    * Part-of-speech tagger
    * Dependency parser
    * Text classifier


### More things to do with spaCy (2)

* [Customizing the tokenizer](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#tokenization)
    * Adding rules and exceptions to split text differently

* [Adding or improving support for other languages](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features)
    * 60+ languages currently
    * Lots of room for improvement and more languages
    * Allows training models for other languages
