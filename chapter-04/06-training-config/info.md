Q: The config.cfg file is the “single source of truth” for training a pipeline with spaCy. Which of the following is not true about the config?

A: It creates an installable Python package with your pipeline.

Response: The config file includes all settings related to training and how to set up the pipeline, but it doesn’t package your pipeline. To create an installable Python package, you can use the spacy package command.
